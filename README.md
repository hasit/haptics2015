# Eureka: Haptic Physics Learning Tool

Concepts of Physics are best understood when paired with practical experiences. In addition to establishing the link between the abstract and the tangible, experiments enhance the kinesthetic experience which, in turn, strengthens learning.

Physics experiments are conventionally restricted to specialized computer simulations or costly physical equipment. We are designing an educational tool that uses Haptic Feedback to enhance the experience of learning the fundamentals of Physics through experiments.

The app will allow users to simulate complex environments, compute forces acting on objects and predict the results. The user can construct different scenarios by placing objects, moving them across the screen and watching the environment react. They can adjust variables like gravity, weights of objects, elevation, and friction of surfaces.

Haptic feedback is employed to simulate forces in order to give a realistic field of experimentation, as compared to conventional tools.
